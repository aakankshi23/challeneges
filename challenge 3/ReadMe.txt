#We have a nested object. We would like a function where you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. 
#Example Input
  
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a


This folder contains a python script that inputs a nested object and returs the value using get_nested_value(obj, key) function
